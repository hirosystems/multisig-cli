## Examples

### Recieving Funds

1. Get any Ledger public keys needed
   ```sh
   npm start -- get_pub <path>
   ```
   If you are unsure of what `path` to use to generate the pubkey for your account, try `m/5757'/0'/0/0/0` or `m/44'/5757'/0/0/0`

2. Create a multisig address from pubkeys
   ```sh
   npm start -- make_multi
   ```

3. Use any wallet to send funds to the address

### Single Transaction Using User Input

While using this tool, inputs/outputs will be in base64-encoded JSON.
You will need to copy/paste this between steps to manage application state.

1. Create a transaction
   ```sh
   npm start -- create_tx
   ```

2. For each required signature, sign with Ledger
   ```sh
   npm start -- sign
   ```

3. **[Optional]** Print transaction as JSON to check
   ```sh
   npm start -- decode
   ```

3. Broadcast transaction
   ```sh
   npm start -- broadcast
   ```

### Bulk Transactions

1. Create the transactions from a CSV file and save outputs to file
   ```sh
   npm start -- create_tx --csv-inputs $CSV_INPUTS_FILE --out-file transactions.json
   ```

2. Sign the transactions and save outputs to file
   ```sh
   npm start -- sign --json-txs transactions.json --csv-keys $CSV_KEYS_FILE --out-file signed_transactions.json
   ```

3. Broadcast transactions
   ```sh
   npm start -- broadcast --json-txs signed_transactions.json --out-file broadcast_results.json
   ```

## Using Docker

You will need Docker and `just` (can be installed by `cargo install just`)

### Building the Image

```sh
just build
```

### Running the Image

Run the same way you would run normally, but replace the `npm start --` prefix with:

```sh
just run [args...]
```
